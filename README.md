# 🚀 Agile Software Development – JUnit Test Suite for `bankingApp.java`

In this project, I developed a robust **JUnit 5 test suite** to support the Agile development of a Java application called `bankingApp.java`. The codebase was fully **refactored for testability**, modularity, and future scalability — ready for class-based redesign.

# 🧩 What I Built: Smart, Scalable, and Testable Java Code

- 🔄 **Refactored legacy Java code** to support modular unit testing  
- 🧪 Developed a **comprehensive JUnit 5 test suite** to ensure code quality and reliability  
- 🧰 Designed the structure to allow **easy addition/removal of methods** or full object-oriented refactoring

# ⚙️ Powered by JUnit 5: Advanced Testing Techniques

Implemented full-spectrum testing using modern JUnit 5 features:
- `@BeforeAll` – One-time setup  
- `@BeforeEach` – Repeated setup for each test  
- `@Test` – Standard unit tests  
- `@ParameterizedTest` – Run tests with multiple data inputs  
- `@Timeout` – Enforce performance limits  
- `@AfterEach` – Clean up after each test  
- `@AfterAll` – Global teardown after all tests complete

# 💥 Exception Handling: Resilient Code Under Pressure

- ✅ Validated code against **custom exception scenarios**  
- ✅ Verified behavior for **standard Java exceptions**  
- ✅ Ensured **graceful handling of edge cases and failures**

# 📈 Designed for Agility

This project follows Agile principles:
- ✅ Quick iteration and testing cycles  
- ✅ Refactor-friendly codebase  
- ✅ Scalable for future feature expansion or class-based design
 
# 🧪 How to Run the Tests with Code Coverage in Eclipse

Follow these steps to run the test suite and generate code coverage in **Eclipse IDE**:

1. **Open Eclipse** and select your workspace.
2. Go to **File > Import > Existing Projects into Workspace**.
3. Browse to your project folder and click **Finish**.
4. In the **Package Explorer**, right-click on the test class or test package.
5. Select **Coverage As > JUnit Test**.
6. Eclipse will run the tests and display **code coverage results** in the **Coverage** view.
